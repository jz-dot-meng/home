# jzdotmeng.github.io

for all things related to music, food and code

plus other miscellaneous projects i'm working on!

NOTE: this branch is an archive for the old version of the portfolio site, using pure JS/HTML/CSS
to try it out, clone the branch and run 'serve' to get a local instance of the site up. The API calls for the crypto wallet balance are no longer valid, as I updated them for the new React.js version of the site
